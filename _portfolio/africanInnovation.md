In this paper we discuss the concepts and emergence of Innovation Performance, and how to quantify it, primarily working with data from the Global Innovation Index, with emphasis on the African Innovation Performance. We briefly overview existing literature on using machine learning for modeling innovation performance, and use simple machine learning techniques, to analyze and predict the "Mobile App Creation Indicator" from the Global Innovation Index, by using insights from the stack-overflow developers survey. Also, we build and compare models to predict the Innovation Output Sub-index, also from the Global Innovation Index.
