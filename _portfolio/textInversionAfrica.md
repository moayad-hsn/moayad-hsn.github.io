title: "Textual Inversion for Personalization of Diffusion-Based Image Generation."
excerpt: "We use textual inversion to adapt the Stable Diffusion model for text-to-image generation, fine-tuning it with a dataset including LAION 5B and images from African artists to generate culturally specific artistic styles, achieving above-average performance in evaluations."

This project explores the personalization of the Stable Diffusion model for text-to-image generation through textual inversion, focusing on African artistic styles. We fine-tuned the model using a dataset comprising LAION 5B and images from three African artists, resulting in the generation of culturally specific images. The model's performance was evaluated using Mean Opinion Scores, revealing above-average success in incorporating the targeted artistic styles. The findings highlight the model's robustness in generating text-conditioned images that reflect diverse and specific cultural influences, with potential for further enhancement in style representation and training efficiency.
