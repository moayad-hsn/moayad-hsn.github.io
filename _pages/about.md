I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher specializing in Responsible AI and Low-Resource NLP for the Global South.

Currently, I work at TrustStamp, where I design secure identity systems and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for hallucination and faithfulness in production. I am also a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University (MS '22), where I focused on speech recognition for East African languages.


My research goal: I am working on building safe, culturally aligned LLMs for critical domains in Africa. I am interested in how we can measure safety and helpfulness in lower resource high impact languages without compromising utility.


### I am currently applying for PhD positions for Fall 2026.

# Current Research Focus: Safety for African LLMs
As LLMs become the first line of defense for mental health support in Africa, we risk deploying models that are culturally misaligned or unsafe. I am currently designing benchmarks to measure safety, helpfulness, and calibration of LLMs in Swahili and Arabic, specifically for youth-typical scenarios.
