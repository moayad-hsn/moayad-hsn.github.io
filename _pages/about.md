Hi, I’m Moayad Elamin, a machine learning engineer working on responsible AI for low-resource languages.

CMU'23 Graduate with a Masters in Engineering Artificial Intelligence (MSEAI'23)

I design and evaluate AI systems that serve African communities safely.

I've published work in ICLR and EMNLP workshops, and in IEEE's ICCCEEE and IST-Africa in topics on East African Speech Recognition and in Reinforcement Learning for Energy.


# Selected Experiences

## Professional Experiences
- **Trust Stamp**: Built privacy-preserving, AI-based digital identity systems and strengthened model security through adversarial and watermarking techniques.
- **RICOS Engineering**: Designed renewable microgrids for refugee camps and reduced operational costs by 20% using data-driven optimization.
- **Innovation Baylasan**: Directed data science initiatives and developed forecasting tools for social-impact organizations.

## Research
- **Enhancing Arabic Readability Prediction with Hybrid BERT and Linguistic Features**: Developed a hybrid model combining deep contextual representations from AraBERTv02 with over 100 engineered linguistic features (lexical, morphological, and syntactic).
- **Multilingual ASR for Kinyarwanda Language**: Developed Kinyarwanda, Swahili, and Luganda speech models using conformers and community-sourced data.
- **Generating African Artistic Styles Using Textual Inversion**: Introduced a framework to create “learned words” that embed regional aesthetics directly into text-to-image models, enabling culturally grounded and interpretable generative art.
- **Enhancing Energy Trading Between Islanded Microgrids**: Optimized energy trading between islanded grids using PPO, reducing simulated costs by 20%.
- **Attention-Based Speech Recognition**: Designed an attention-based ASR model achieving strong results on the WSJ benchmark.

## Community Building
- **Zindi.africa**: Served as the Country Ambassador for Sudan.
- **Deep Learning IndabaX**: Organized and mentored teams for IndabaX Sudan and IndabaX Rwanda.
- **IEEE Sudan**: Led, organized, and advised on various initiatives to promote AI and machine learning.

## Research Vision

Across all these projects, my goal is to design AI systems that are:

- **Locally aligned** with linguistic and cultural context

- **Efficient and transparent** deployable under limited compute

- **Collaboratively governed** co-developed with stakeholders, and communities
